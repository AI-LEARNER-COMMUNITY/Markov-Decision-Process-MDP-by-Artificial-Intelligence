# Markov-Decision-Process-MDP-by-Artificial-Intelligence
Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a mathematical framework used to model decision-making in situations where an agent interacts with an environment over a series of discrete time steps. MDPs are a fundamental concept in reinforcement learning and provide a formal structure for studying and solving problems.
